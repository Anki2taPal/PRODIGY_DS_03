# PRODIGY_DS_03
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Task 3 of my data science internship at ProdigyInfotech. This repository contains all the code, datasets, and documentation related to the bank marketing project assigned during the internship.

# Overview

In this task, we focus on analyzing a bank marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The project involves extensive data visualization, outlier detection, and correlation analysis, culminating in the development of a decision tree classifier to make predictions.

<ul><li>Creation of insightful plots to explore customer demographics and behaviors.</li>
<li>Identification and handling of outliers to ensure model performance.</li>
<li>Analysis of feature correlations to understand relationships and multicollinearity.</li>
<li>Implementation of a decision tree model to predict customer purchase behavior, with thorough evaluation using appropriate metrics.</li></ul>

# Knowledge Gained
